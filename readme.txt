Unique Comment Notify appends the author's name to subject of notification e-mails.

== Description ==

Unique Comment Notify appends the comment author's name to the subject of the
notification message sent to the blogger. This prevents Gmail and other
threading e-mail clients from grouping all notification e-mails for a post
into one conversation.

== Installation ==

1. Upload unique-comment-notify.zip to your Wordpress plugins directory (usually in `wp-content/plugins`).
1. Unzip the file and you should see the folder `unique-comment-notify` in the plugins directory.
1. Activate the plugin in your Wordpress Administrator page's plugin section (usually something like `http://example.com/wp-admin/plugins.php`).
